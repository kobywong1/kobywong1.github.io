								<p>Using data from a British National Gambling Survey provided by the National Centre for Social Research, I analyze the effects of income on national lottery participation in the UK based on the framework provided by models of Prospect Theory and the Friedman-Savage Model. A range of different econometric approaches such as OLS and tobit models were initially considered, before a binary probit model is chosen as it is the most applicable for the specified data. A differentiation between household and personal income as two seperate variables included in the regression found surprisingly opposite trends, with lottery participation increasing with decreasing household income and lottery participation increasing with increasing personal income. After a series of robustness checks, I argue how effects of wealth inherent in income is captured by household income variables, while personal income variables reveal a relative measure of income satisfaction that can be captured only when household income variables are controlled for, offering a potential extension in the topic of the economics of happiness.<br/><br/>
									This paper was made using Stata. Other than the technical skills of coding, the project allowed me to gain experiences in statistical model design in choosing the right approach to mitigate problems of model misspecification, heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity and other econometric shortcomings. The project also gave me insights on data visualization - illustrating complex, extensive data in a simple, organized fashion, a skill that is of massive importance in the field of data analytics.
