								<p> Data for this project is sourced from Kaggle (Available at: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sadeght/industrial-production-electric-and-gas-utilities">https://www.kaggle.com/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog</a>). Basic time series analysis was conducted on the US Energy Production Index from 1950 to 2018 by fitting a trend and seasonal component onto the dataset using time series regression. This project allowed me to gain a very basic understanding of interpreting ACF and PACF plots, testing for non-stationarity using KPSS tests, forecasting, as well as interpreting trends of seasonality and overall trend. Results show a quadratic trend relationship between energy production and time, and W shaped seasonality with peaks during the summer and winter, matching expectations. <br/><br/>
									This project was conducted using Python, giving me experience in using Jupyter Notebook. The exercise also gave me a basic overview of all considerations when attempting to fit a time series model.
